            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>ONE of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Life of Man, said it was (or at least ought to be) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a MEDITATION of DEATH:</hi> He should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have said, <hi>a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of another Life,</hi> tho' I suppose he
<pb facs="tcp:205476:3"/> meant it not of Death in it <hi>self,</hi> but as it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to a <hi>Better Life</hi> beyond it. But alas! how few are there that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Thoughts upon such a Subject! since the generality of Men do live <hi>tanquam semper vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturi,</hi> as though they were to live here <hi>always,</hi> or rather as if they thought their Souls and Bodies should <hi>perish together</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:205476:3"/> without the hopes of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. And tho' <hi>Life and Immortality be brought to light by the Gospel,</hi> yet even the Professors of it do too little exercise their minds in such Contemplations. Sometimes perhaps the Crosses and Troubles they meet with here below, may force their thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and induce them to think on that uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb facs="tcp:205476:4"/> Peace and Felicity they expect hereafter; but this is usually but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanea Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> Calvin. and they presently return to their former course of minding earthly things. And which is the strangest of all, those that have some good As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of an Interest in a future Life of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and have experienced the <hi>Comfortable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:205476:4"/> of it here, yet as they too seldom employ their thoughts about it, so they are too often unwilling to depart hence, that they may enter in and possess it. I know if one should come to any of them, and ask them, <hi>If they be willing to go to Heaven?</hi> they would presently answer, <hi>Yes, with all their hearts!</hi> but if Death look them in
<pb facs="tcp:205476:5"/> the Face in a fit of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or some other eminent Danger, then they recoil, and entertain the thoughts of it with great reluctancy; then Heaven is besieged with earnest and repeated Prayers for their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and if their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests be granted, and their Lives continued, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the proneness of Men to Ingratitude and forgetfulness of God's
<pb facs="tcp:205476:5"/> Mercies, yet usually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occasion they are very free and hearty in their acknowledgments.</p>
                  <p>This is a thing I have sometimes wondred at in Serious Christians, who have profess<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>d themselves to be <hi>Strangers and Pilgrims here,</hi> and <hi>to seek a better Country,</hi> and yet could look upon the continuance of their <hi>Exile</hi> in a World
<pb facs="tcp:205476:6"/> full of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> as so great a Mercy. As if they should say, <hi>Lord, we bless and praise thy Name that thou hast not yet made us perfectly happy; we admire thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out our Exile and Bondage, and continuing us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer absent
<pb facs="tcp:205476:6"/> from thy Self. Thou mightest ere this have brought us to a full enjoyment of thy Self in unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bliss and Glory. Thou mightest ere this have brought us into a state of perfect Purity and Holiness, where we should no more have disobey'd thy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Laws, no more
<pb facs="tcp:205476:7"/> have grieved thy HOLY SPIRIT, no more have abused thy Grace, but have been equally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Serving and Enjoying Thee to perfection. But thou hast been graciously pleased to continue us a little longer in this Vale of Sin and Misery, where we shall still be expos'd
<pb facs="tcp:205476:7"/> to the Temptations of Satan, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them; where we shall still be over-born by our own Corruptions, &amp; by our Sins often provoke thee to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against us; where we shall still feel the effects of our Sins and of thy Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for them in
<pb facs="tcp:205476:8"/> those many troubles and afflictions we shall meet with as long as we continue here, and out of which thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us hopes that thou wilt not yet deliver us,</hi> &amp;c. But how <hi>unsuitable</hi> is this to the <hi>Profession</hi> that is generally made of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to depart, and to be with Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:205476:8"/> which is far better!</hi> And tho' some may think this too uncharitable an Interpretation of such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, which are usually worded in such terms as renders them much more plausible both to themselves and others; yet if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did but seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the deceitfulness of their own Hearts, and how much of the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and of <hi>Earthly</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:205476:9"/> things remains unmortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the best of Men, it would make them ready to suspect the most plausible excuses for their desires of Long Life. Among which there is none of more seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weight than their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedness for Death: to which I Answer, that the Persons I am speaking to are suppos'd to be already (at least in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) prepared for it; or else
<pb facs="tcp:205476:9"/> it would indeed be rashness &amp; presumption to desire to leave this World when they are not qualified for being happy in another. But those that have experienc'd a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al work of Grace upon their hearts, that have found in their own Souls those Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiae Regni, the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Operations of the holy Spirit, 'tis impossible for them to miscarry. Such souls have a natural Tendency
<pb facs="tcp:205476:10"/> &amp; <hi>Inclination</hi> towards Heaven, both in Life and at Death, and cannot miss of it. But if they say, they desire time to be <hi>further</hi> prepared for so great a Change, I grant that we cannot indeed be too well prepared for that state wherein we are to be for ever; and therefore it does highly concern every one to improve the time of Life allotted to them to
<pb facs="tcp:205476:10"/> the best advantage, and to make themselves as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as they can; yet I would desire them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that such is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching Nature of this World, that the <hi>longer</hi> we live in it, the more <hi>unwilling</hi> we are to leave it; and that length of time will not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our <hi>Graces,</hi> but also discover our <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,</hi> so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb facs="tcp:205476:11"/> we are in <hi>reality,</hi> we shall always be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in our <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> and perhaps more hereafter than at present.</p>
                  <p>To perswade therefore my self and others to be content to leave a <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi> World, and willing to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>holy</hi> and eternally <hi>happy,</hi> was the design of composing the ensuing <hi>Miscellanies,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:205476:11"/> were written at several times, and are now se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of many others on different Subjects: and if they may be any ways serviceable to this end, I shall not altogether repent of their Publication.</p>

                        <q>For where your Treasure is, there will your Hearts be also.</q>
                     </epigraph>
                     <p>BLUSH and be ashamed, O my Soul, that thou art such a Stranger to a Heavenly Life: That thou should'st be so careful and sollicitous about the things of this <hi>World,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless of the affairs of Heaven, and the concerns of <hi>Eternity.</hi> Dost thou believe thou hast a <hi>Treasure</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:205476:15"/> in Heaven, why then is not thy <hi>Heart</hi> there also? How is it that thou dost so seldom think on it? but thy mind is continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon Earthly Vanities. Dost thou pretend to be a <hi>Stranger</hi> and a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> on Earth, and yet art thou for building <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> and wilt thou say (or at least think) <hi>It is good to be here?</hi> Dost thou pretend to be <hi>travelling</hi> to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Country, and wilt thou never think <hi>whither</hi> thou art going, nor spend a thought on thy Journey's <hi>end?</hi> Dost thou believe that Christ is gone before to prepare a <hi>Mansion</hi> for thee, and would it not do well by a Holy Contemplation to go and see whether thou shalt like thy Dwelling? Surely it would be worth the while to ascend the Mount and take a view of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:205476:15"/> Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> How would it make thee long to be there, and be willing to do or suffer any thing so thou maist have a part in the Inheritance of those that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified? How would it make thee <hi>despise</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and all the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Profits,</hi> and <hi>Pleasures</hi> of it? How <hi>little</hi> would they then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in thine eyes! How <hi>light</hi> would all Afflictions seem when thou knowest that they will work out for thee <hi>such</hi> an exceeding weight of Glory? How patiently would'st thou bear them, and be fully satisfied with this, That <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> will make amends for all.</p>
                     <p>LORD bring me out of this <hi>worse</hi> than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery and Bondage; this bondage to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan;</hi> this <hi>Sodom,</hi> out of which I am so loath to depart; and let
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205476:16"/> me escape to the <hi>Mountains.</hi> Let me no more long after the <hi>Flesh-pots</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but let me tast the sweetness of Spiritual <hi>Manna.</hi> Oh that I could sometimes go (with the <hi>Spies</hi>) to search the <hi>Promised Land,</hi> and cut down a Cluster of Grapes at the Brook <hi>Eshcol,</hi> which would make me long for the full Vintage. Lord help me to set my affections on <hi>things above,</hi> and not on things on earth. Alas! what is there here that deserves a heart? And what heart does not owe all its Love to thee? Lord grant that I may say from my very heart, <hi>Whom have I in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee, and there is none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth I desire in comparison of thee.</hi> Be thou my Portion, and the Lot of my Inheritance, and I may well say, <hi>The lines are fallen
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205476:16"/> to me in pleasant places, and I have a goodly heritage.</hi> And grant that now at length I may lay up for my self a <hi>Treasure</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and then <hi>my Heart will be there also.</hi>

                        <q>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>

                     <p>WHAT is there in this World that should make us so loath to leave it? Is <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation</hi> of Spirit so <hi>Desirable?</hi> And there is nothing else to be found here. Nothing but <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>troubles, wants</hi> and <hi>losses, crosses</hi> and <hi>disappointments</hi> to be met with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205476:17"/> in this Life. That which we call <hi>Contentment,</hi> how often do we seek and hunt after it in vain? And no wonder, since we seek for it where it is not to be found. We are apt to think 'tis in <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and all our endeavours are bent to gain that, and we fondly think, Oh if we had but <hi>such</hi> a thing, then we should be <hi>happy!</hi> Whereas if God be pleased to grant our desires, we often find those very Enjoyments which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so <hi>Charming,</hi> to be <hi>empty</hi> of that Comfort we expected in them, or else so many Crosses do attend them, as <hi>imbitters</hi> all the sweetness that is in them. And after all this, we must <hi>part</hi> with them, and the <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> which attends the <hi>Loss</hi> of them is usually <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>longer</hi> than
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:205476:17"/> the <hi>pleasure</hi> we enjoyed in them.</p>
                     <p>WHO then would set their hearts upon the Comforts, the <hi>empty, fading, perishing</hi> Comforts and Enjoyments of this Life, and not rather desire to <hi>depart,</hi> and to <hi>be with Christ,</hi> which is <hi>far better?</hi> The Joys of Heaven are <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial, full</hi> and <hi>satisfactory, pure</hi> and <hi>unmixed, constant</hi> and <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. There</hi> all <hi>tears</hi> shall be wip'd away from our eyes, and <hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>sighing</hi> shall flee away and be heard of no more for ever. <hi>There</hi> we shall be free from all <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>sicknesses</hi> of <hi>body,</hi> and all <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>perplexity</hi> of <hi>mind. There</hi> we shall be free from all the <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil. <hi>There</hi> we shall be free from all <hi>Sin,</hi> and the fears of God's <hi>displeasure</hi> for it. <hi>There</hi> we shall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205476:18"/> meet with all our <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> that are gone before us; <hi>there</hi> we shall <hi>meet</hi> and never <hi>part</hi> again. But above all, <hi>there</hi> we shall <hi>be with Christ,</hi> which is far better than all, and in him enjoy unspeakable, unconceivable Bliss and Happiness to all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>LORD grant that as I do, or at least ought to <hi>desire</hi> to depart, so I may be also <hi>ready,</hi> that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou comest, thou maist find me watching, and say unto me, Well done! Enter into thy Master's Joy.</p>

                        <bibl>JOHN XIV. 22.</bibl>
                        <q>Lord! how is it that thou wilt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest thy self unto us, and not unto the World?</q>
                     </epigraph>
                     <p>WELL might the Disciples wonder at this condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and distinguishing Love of their Lord and Master. And yet his <hi>Promise</hi> immediately before (as also his <hi>Prayer</hi> afterwards) was not design'd to respect <hi>them</hi> only, but <hi>all that shall believe in him through their word. He that hath my Commandments,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and keepeth them,</hi> (whosoever he be to the World's end) <hi>he it is that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me; and he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205476:19"/> will love him, and will manifest my self unto him.</hi> I will shew him my Glory <hi>now</hi> in some measure, and I will pray the Father that he may be with me and see my Glory <hi>hereafter.</hi> I will not only <hi>Love</hi> him, but I will <hi>manifest</hi> that Love to him, and let him see and feel it, and the happy effects of it. And is this the manner of Men to deal so familiarly with their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? And is it not much more wonderful that the Lord of Life and Glory should so far condescend as to reveal himself to poor despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Worms! Have we not reason to cry out with the <hi>Psalmist, Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is not all; for this is a <hi>peculiar</hi> favour to his Chosen.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205476:19"/> He is pleas'd to manifest himself to <hi>them,</hi> and not unto the <hi>World.</hi> Unto them he turns the bright side of the Cloud, while others, like the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> are in darkness. <hi>To you</hi> (says he) <hi>it is given to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to others it is not given.</hi> Oh, how may we admire this distinguishing Love of our Divine Redeemer! and how may we (how can we but) rejoyce in it! As he once said to his Disciples, <hi>I have meat to eat which ye know not of;</hi> So may we say to the World, We have Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to feed and feast our Souls with, which you know not of. No, our Joys are such as <hi>Strangers</hi> do not <hi>intermeddle</hi> with. 'Tis not only <hi>Propriety,</hi> but <hi>Peculiarity</hi> which adds sweetness to all our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205476:20"/> Enjoyments, and both are here. <hi>We are thine, thou never barest rule over them, they were not called by thy Name,</hi> Isa. 63. 19. <hi>He hath not dealt so with any Nation, and as for his Judgments they have not known them,</hi> Psal. 147. 20.</p>
                     <p>And why then are we not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with our Portion, but are ready to envy the enjoyments of the wicked? If <hi>we</hi> have Joys which <hi>they</hi> do not intermeddle with, why should we desire to intermeddle with <hi>theirs?</hi> Are not ours better, or would we <hi>change</hi> with them? Surely no: why then are we not abundantly contented with our Lot and Portion? If the Lord be our Portion, then surely we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but say, <hi>The lines are fallen to us in pleasant places, and we have a goodly heritage.</hi> And how can
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:205476:20"/> we be sad or troubled? Does the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteousness shine upon us, and can we hang down our Heads? Does our dear Redeemer <hi>smile</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and can we be sorrowful in any condition? May he not say to us, as <hi>Elkanah</hi> did to <hi>Hannah, Why is thy countenance sad? Am not I better to thee than ten Sons,</hi> than ten Friends? Could <hi>Micah</hi> say of his Idols, <hi>Ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more? And do ye ask what aileth me?</hi> And may not we better say, Ye <hi>cannot</hi> take away our God, but we have his comfortable presence with us, and what can we have more, or how can we ail any thing? Could <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> being ask'd by <hi>Alexander,</hi> (who it seems stood betwixt him and the Sun) what he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of him, and he should have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205476:21"/> it, could he answer, <hi>Nunc quidem paululum Ã  Sole absis. At present only stand out of my Sunshine?</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero. And can we desire any thing more than the warming comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beams of the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness? And would it not better become us than it did him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse and contemn all those vain Pleasures, Profits, and Honours, which would obscure the light of God's Countenance, and hide his Face from us?</p>
                     <p>Oh Lord! Lift but thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me, and it will put joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into my Heart more than when Corn and Wine (and all other Comforts) increased.</p>

                        <bibl>MICAH II. 10.</bibl>
                        <q>Arise ye, and depart, for this is not your rest.</q>
                     </epigraph>
                     <p>'TIS an amazing thing to consider the <hi>perverseness</hi> of men, that nothing can beat them off from expecting Rest and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in <hi>this World,</hi> nor perswade them to seek it in a better. Tho' they have been told over and over of the Experiences of <hi>all men,</hi> in <hi>all states</hi> and <hi>conditions,</hi> and in <hi>all Ages,</hi> how they have been cross'd in all their pursuits after Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and disappointed of all their hopes of finding <hi>Rest</hi> and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in any thing here below; yet such is the <hi>incredulity</hi> of men,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:205476:22"/> that they will not believe the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations of those that have gone before them, but they must needs try <hi>themselves</hi> before they will be convinced of a Truth so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally owned and acknowledged. And it were well if even <hi>that</hi> would satisfie them, but alas it will not; for tho' they have made the Experiment themselves again and again in vain, and have met with nothing but crosses and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all their days hitherto, yet will they not say, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> but will lay the fault on the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> of <hi>Enemies,</hi> or <hi>unfaithfulness</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> or their own <hi>Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or any thing but the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the things themselves, which one would think so much dear-bought Experience might suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convince them are <hi>uncapable</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:205476:22"/> of affording them that Comfort and Satisfaction they expected from them. And this were still more <hi>excusable</hi> if they had never heard of a place where this Rest is <hi>certainly</hi> to be found, nor had ever been shewn the <hi>way</hi> to obtain it. But even those that know this, and pretend to believe that Heaven is a place of <hi>perfect</hi> Rest and Happiness, and seem to make it their business to walk in the way to it, and to endeavour to qualifie themselves for the obtaining and enjoyment of it, yet even those are unwilling to <hi>arise and depart,</hi> unwilling to be where they are <hi>sure</hi> to be <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>eternally</hi> Happy.</p>
                     <p>BUT why (O my Soul) dost thou thus accuse others, as if thou wert clear in this matter, when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:205476:23"/> alas! thou art equally involved in the same guilt with other men? Notwithstanding thou hast met with so large a Portion of <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which might have weaned thee from this World, and make thee desirous of a better. But alas, how little of those Effects have they produced in thee? How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hast thou chang'd thy Opinion of those earthly things? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed thou makest sad <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints</hi> of the <hi>emptiness</hi> of Earthly Comforts, and of the <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>vexation</hi> that attends all worldly enjoyments, but this is only in a <hi>pet,</hi> upon some great Cross and Disappointment, when the afflictive sense of it is worn off a little, thou presently returnest to thy old course, and renewest thy vain pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits after that which has always deluded thy expectations.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:205476:34"/> and hast digged to thy self Cisterns, which have proved <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Cisterns</hi> that would hold no Water: (For thou hast experienc'd enough of <hi>Earth</hi> too, to let thee see its <hi>vanity,</hi> and feel its <hi>vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and to convince thee that all things here below, even the <hi>best</hi> of earthly Comsorts are flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and <hi>uncertain,</hi> and not only <hi>unsatisfying</hi> but <hi>tormenting</hi> and then surely very unfit to be chosen and rested in as thy Felicity:) Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding (I say) thou hast so often run away from <hi>God,</hi> and sought Rest, and Happiness, and Contentment in the <hi>Creature,</hi> he has only let thee alone a while to take thy choice, that thou mightest smart a little for thy folly; and then as soon as thou hast returned to him, he has received thee, and

And doubt not but whatever thou leavest or losest <hi>for</hi> him, thou wilt find it abundantly supplyed <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> him.

                     <p>Lord! be thou my Portion in the Land of the Living, and let me not only <hi>chuse thee,</hi> but make it appear (it will thereby appear) that thou hast <hi>chosen me.</hi> I am too apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more Happiness and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Creatures</hi> than they are ever able to afford me; but from <hi>thee</hi> I can never expect the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth

                     <p>NOW, O my Soul, mount up like the generous Lark, and sing Praises unto thy God. It is but fit that he should have the <hi>First-fruits</hi> of thy <hi>Thoughts</hi> (this day and every day) from whom thou hast the <hi>power</hi> to <hi>think.</hi> Oh let not Sin or Vanity deflower and ravish thy

And yet how often has he stood at the Door knocking, <hi>till his head was filled with the dew, and his locks with the drops of the night,</hi> Cant. 5. 2. and thou hast <hi>refused</hi> to rise and open to him; nay, worse than so, when thou hast risen and opened, thou hast let in <hi>Sin,</hi> and shut out thy Saviour!

                     <p>BLUSH and be ashamed, O my Soul, that thou should'st be so much pleased and delighted with any thing here below, tho' never so sweet and grateful.

O consider whether thy <hi>Practice</hi> agrees with thy <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> or not, whilest thy Heart is so taken up with these Earthly Enjoyments.

O then be ashamed of this thy Folly; and whenever thou art again tempted to over-value Earthly Enjoyments, say, <hi>Arise and depart, for this is not thy Rest,</hi> Micah 2. 10.

Oh do thou raise my Affections from this Earth, and bring me into a nearer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>Thee,</hi> and then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I should not delight so much in the <hi>Creature.</hi> Tho' my Heart and Affections be <hi>naturally</hi> bent upon these inferiour Objects, yet Oh shew forth thy <hi>Almighty Power</hi> in raising them. As he said, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</hi> Matth. 8. 2. So I may say, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make

                     <p>I HAVE observed, that tho' I am forgetful enough of other things, yet I never (or very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) forget to wind up my Watch. And I have oft wonder'd at it, that tho' I be never so intent upon other things, yet as sure as I rise in the Morning, and go to bed at Night, so sure. I am to remember this.</p>

                     <p>BUT alas, how negligent am I in the mean time of my <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Watch!</hi> How little careful am I to keep it <hi>going</hi> continually? How often do I let it <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>stand still,</hi> and when it does go, how faint and slow are its Motions? When I am alone in my Study, or awake in my Bed, I can hear my Watch go apace, but alas, in the mean time how faint and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid are the motions of my Soul <hi>Heaven ward?</hi> Surely if I was but as careful every Morning to wind up my <hi>Affections</hi> Heaven-ward, by the earnest and lively Exercise of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love, Desire</hi> and <hi>Hope, Joy</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness:</hi> O how vigorously would the Pulse of my Soul beat all the day after! What Heavenly <hi>Breathings,</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:205476:42"/> pious <hi>Ejaculations</hi> would continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be breaking forth? And tho' when I am amongst the <hi>croud</hi> and <hi>noise</hi> of the World, and the vain Concernments of it, I cannot so well perceive whether this my Spiritual Watch go or not; yet no sooner am I out of that hurry, and retir'd alone, but then I might easily discern it again. O that my Soul were always in such a frame! Oh that the continual <hi>bent</hi> of my Soul was towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and that it was <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>grief</hi> to me to think of any thing else! But alas! what a great deal of pains must I be at to wind up this dull and earthly Heart of mine, and then how quickly is it down again!</p>

When I wind it up in the <hi>Morning</hi> I may think, My Watch has kept going all this Night (as I see by the Motion of the Hand) but I have been in a <hi>sottish, senseless sleep,</hi> and wholly unserviceable either to God or

When I look at it again at <hi>Night,</hi> may it not suggest to me such thoughts as these? Here are now so many hours past away since I look'd at it last, which can never be <hi>recalled;</hi> but what have I done for God or my Soul all this time? These hours were not given me to please my <hi>Flesh</hi> in, or to serve my <hi>Self</hi> in, but to serve <hi>God</hi> in; and how little of his Work have I done?

                     <p>THIS Morning I took a walk into the Fields, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:205476:46"/> amongst other delightful Objects, I was very much pleased with the <hi>singing</hi> of the <hi>Birds,</hi> and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Larks,</hi> which I observ'd to mount and ascend towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and unweariedly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to sing the Praises of their great Creator.</p>
                     <p>IT presently came into my thoughts, that this was a very fit Emblem of a <hi>Christian's Life,</hi> whose Conversation is in Heaven, and whose Affections are set on things above, and whose daily Business it is to shew forth the Praises of him who has called him out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into his marvellous light.
